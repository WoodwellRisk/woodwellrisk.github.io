In the risk group at Woodwell Climate Research Center, we perform a variety of climate analyses in order to deliver comprehensive risk assessments. 

It is part of our mission to ensure that everything we do is open access and open source. On this website you can find more information on the methodologies used in our analysis suite and the code used to generate our data. 

For more information on what we do, please read about our <a href='https://www.woodwellclimate.org/project/just-access/' target='_blank'>Just Access</a> initiative and visit the main website for <a href='https://www.woodwellclimate.org/' target='_blank'>Woodwell Climate Research Center</a>.

### How to use this website

You can navigate through the different sections of this website using the sidebar. 

Each of our climate themes has it's own page under **Climate Risks**. On each page, you will find an overview of our analyses, including information on methodology (or where to go to find it). 

Under the **Data & Tools** section, we provide information on the datasets we use (e.g. CMIP model ensembles), and some of our key tools.

Woodwell Risk strives to make all of our code and data open acess and open source. If we have published code for generating a particular dataset or for demonstrating a given method, you can click on the GitHub icon <img src="/assets/images/github-icon.png" alt="GitHub icon" style="width:33px;"/> to be taken to its repository. You can also explore some datasets interactively by clicking the display icon <img src="/assets/images/display-icon.svg" alt="display icon" style="width: 33px;"/> if it is included in the dataset's name.
