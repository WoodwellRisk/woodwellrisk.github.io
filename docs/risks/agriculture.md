# Agriculture
*Globally, agriculture uses more freshwater than any other sector. Global warming affects our ability to grow food because of the way it pushes drought, rainfall, and temperature patterns towards extremes outside the narrow range of conditions that common staple crops like maize, rice, wheat, and soy are used to.*

## Crop Failure <a href='https://woodwellrisk.github.io/viewer?category=agriculture&layer=cf_rain' target='_blank'>:material-monitor:{ .md }</a>
In this analysis, crop yield failures are projected by the AgMIP ensemble of global gridded crop models driven by CMIP6 climate models under emissions scenario SSP5-8.5 (<a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00400-y' target='_blank'> JÃ¤germeyr et al., 2021 </a>). Projected changes in crop yields are affected by climate, water, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Through selecting specific simulation runs, different scenarios can be created with or without the CO2 fertilization effect as well as under full or no irrigation.
